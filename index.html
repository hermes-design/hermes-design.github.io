        <h1 class="title">HERMES-Design: Human-Centric Collaborative Architectural Decision-Making for Secure System Design</h1>
      </div>
      
      <p class="summary"><u>Summary</u>: <em>The current state of tools and methods for collaborative architectural decision-making mainly emphasizes knowledge sharing, reuse, compromises, and seeking consensus among diverse stakeholders. However, our observation reveals a significant oversight in considering the decision-making constraints of various stakeholders in relation to human factors during the development process. For example, when dealing with the design of secure systems, it becomes essential to thoroughly comprehend the benefits and limitations of potential solutions like cryptography, authentication, access control, auditing, and more. The project aims to develop a formal modeling framework that takes into account human factors in architectural decision-making, particularly those related to the expertise and experience of team members involved in collaborative decision-making processes. More broadly, this research will enhance our understanding of how collaborative decisions are made and provide better traceability of decisions impacting system security. Consequently, it will increase confidence in the decisions made by a diverse team of members.</em></p>
