This paper demonstrates how a probabilistic model checker, specifically the PRISM-games, can be effectively used to model collaborative maintenance between on-orbit and ground staff. We evaluated the collaborative operation's effectiveness by performing a RAM (Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability) analysis on the satellite system. Previous research has primarily focused on improving model performance, neglecting the role of human intervention and response to failures.

Our future work will concentrate on analyzing maintenance strategies for constellations of satellite systems while ensuring a certain level of communication reliability between staff and equipment. This will ultimately lead to improved maintenance planning and investment optimization.
